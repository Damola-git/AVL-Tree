# AVL Trees

## Introduction
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring balanced tree structure and efficient operations.

## Core Operations
### Insertion
- Inserting a new node into an AVL tree involves a standard binary search tree insertion followed by rebalancing the tree if necessary to maintain the AVL property.

### Deletion
- Deleting a node from an AVL tree involves a standard binary search tree deletion followed by rebalancing the tree to ensure the AVL property is preserved.

### Rotation
- AVL trees use rotations (single or double) to rebalance the tree. These rotations include left rotation, right rotation, left-right rotation, and right-left rotation.

## Applications
- AVL trees are commonly used in applications where fast search, insert, and delete operations are required.
- They are widely used in databases and file systems to maintain sorted data and allow logarithmic time complexity for search operations.

## Advantages
- Ensures O(log n) complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations due to balanced nature.
- Provides better performance for lookup-intensive applications compared to unbalanced binary search trees.

## Disadvantages
- AVL trees require more rotations and rebalancing operations, which can add overhead to insertion and deletion operations compared to other balanced trees like Red-Black
